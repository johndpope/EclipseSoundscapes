This is the full eclipse -  for just approximately two minutes, the moon’s black disk completely covers the sun, revealing the sun's massive outer corona. Grand flourishes of light extend from the moon in all directions like flower petals.  Intensely bright at the moon’s edge, these helmet streamers fade to wisps of ghostly white as they stretch across space.

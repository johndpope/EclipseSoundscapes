This is the first moment that the moon, slowly moving from left to right, appears to touch the sun. The intensity of the sun’s light makes it unsafe to look at without special eye protection until the totality, the few minutes during which the moon completely eclipses the sun. The two celestial bodies appear to be the same size, although the sun’s light is so bright that it obliterates all of the moon’s features causing the moon to appear as a smooth, obsidian disk. For the next 90 minutes, the moon’s black disk will creep across the sun, progressively blocking more of sun’s light and heat until the totality.

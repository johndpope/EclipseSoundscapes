This is the first moment that the moon, slowly moving from left to right, appears to touch the sun. The intensity of the sun’s light makes it unsafe to look at without special eye protection until the totality, the few minutes during which the moon completely eclipses the sun. The two celestial bodies appear to be the same size, although the sun’s light is so bright that it obliterates all of the moon’s features causing the moon to appear as a smooth, obsidian disk. For the next 90 minutes, the moon’s black disk will creep across the sun, progressively blocking more of sun’s light and heat until the totality.You can use this time to explore rumble map images and audio descriptions of phenomena unique to a total eclipse. In the moments before, during and after totality, this app will provide a play-by-play of the action, providing images and descriptions of this rare and fascinating stellar event.Additional scientific info:The outer atmosphere of the Sun, called the corona, is usually not visible from the surface of the Earth. To study the corona, scientists send satellites into space to make observations of the corona in wavelengths of light that the human eye cannot see, such as this image of the Sun in X-rays taken by the X-ray Telescope on the Hinode spacecraft. This X-ray image shows the view of the Sun being eclipsed by the moon a seen from space. The total solar eclipse on August 21, 2017 provides the rare opportunity to see the corona from the ground in visible light.

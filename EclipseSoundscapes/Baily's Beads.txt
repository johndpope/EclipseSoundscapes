On the right side of the moon, orbs of glowing sunlight shimmer off the edge of the moon’s black disk. Called Baily’s Beads, these final areas of the sun’s light appear as glimmering pearls on a wire, made intensely bright by the absence of light surrounding them.Explanation of what you might feel as you interact:On the rumble map, explore the difference between the moon, the sun’s corona and Baily’s beads which are intense and irregular.Additional scientific info:Even this small section of the Sun’s light cannot be viewed without special eye protection. Please use special eclipse glasses or filters if viewing this feature directly on the Sun with your eyes.Baily’s beads are caused because the moon’s surface is not a smooth, perfect sphere. Rays of light peer through the ravines and valleys between mountains on the moon causing this spectacular feature.

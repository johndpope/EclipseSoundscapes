Fiery loops of hot pink light appear to leap off the moonâ€™s black surface.  With the sheer white corona as their backdrop, these pink prominences seem to dance above the moon like lines of liquid neon.Explanation of what you might feel as you interact:You will notice a sharp contrast when you interact with a prominence due to its intense brightness relative to the background.Additional scientific info:Prominences are magnetic fields that are filled with very dense material making them much brighter than the surrounding background.  The magnetic fields of prominences can be very complicated giving them complex and dynamic shapes.

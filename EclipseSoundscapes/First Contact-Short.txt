The eclipse has begun and this is the first moment that the moon appears to touch the Sun. The two celestial bodies appear to be the same size, although the sun’s light is so bright that it obliterates all of the moon’s features causing the moon to appear as a smooth, obsidian disk.

For the approximately 90 minutes you will have the opportunity to interact with
the Rumble map and explore features of the Sun that are revealed during an eclipse. Then, during six minutes leading up to, during, and just after totality, the Rumble map will be disabled so that you can hear about the events surrounding totality in real time.

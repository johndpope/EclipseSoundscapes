This is the full eclipse, when the moon’s black disk completely covers the sun. Now, in the absence of the sun’s full light, its massive outer corona is revealed. Uniquely visible during a full eclipse, grand flourishes of light called helmet streamers extend in all directions behind the moon’s black disk. At the edge of the moon, the helmet streamers are intensely bright, fading to wisps of ghostly white as they stretch across space, far from the moon, like flower petals.Explanation of what you might feel as you interact:On the rumble map, explore the difference between the moon and the sun’s corona.Additional scientific info:You may notice changes in temperature and natural sounds, such a birds and wind during the total eclipse.During the total solar eclipse, and only during totality, you can view the corona of the Sun without eye protection.  The Sun’s outer atmosphere, the corona, is in full display and viewable from the ground.  The highly structured nature of the corona is clearly evident.  This structure is caused by the Sun’s intense and complicated magnetic fields interacting with the material that makes up the corona.  This material is called a plasma, which is like a gas, but is susceptible to magnetic fields.  The magnetic fields can then shape the plasma in the corona into the complicated patterns that are viewable during the eclipse.

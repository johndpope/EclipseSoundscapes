During the totality, the moon completely covers the sun’s glowing orb, and the sun’s outer atmosphere is revealed. As if the moon were the center of a celestial sunflower, the corona appears as soft white petals, massive flumes of faint light that taper out across the sky. Closer to the surface of the moon’s flat ebony circle, the corona is a swirling chaos of loops and flares. Intense fiery lines of light appear to ignite the moon’s black edge.How to interact with the rumble mapOn the rumble map, explore the difference between the moon and the sun’s corona. You will hear/feel variations as your fingers pass over different features of the corona.Additional scientific info:The corona is the thin outer atmosphere of the Sun.  With temperatures at over 1 million degrees Fahrenheit, it radiates light in wavelengths that are too short for the human eye to see (like X-rays) and that are absorbed by the Earth’s atmosphere.  However, the corona reflects some of the white light from the Sun’s photosphere below it.  This faint reflection is only seen when the much brighter photosphere is blocked, like during a total eclipse.

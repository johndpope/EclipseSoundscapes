Framed by a larger view of space, the solar wind draws the helmet streamers far out into space as other stars come into view. Many of these stars also have planets orbiting them. Those planets can eclipse their parent star just as the moon eclipsed our Sun. Scientists can detect planets eclipsing their stars and determine both, how far the planet is from its star and the planetâ€™s mass. From these clues and other observations, scientists are attempting to discover if there is life on these other planets that may be experiencing their own eclipse.
